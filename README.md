👋 Introduction

This repository serves as a personal journal of my journey through LeetCode's SQL problems. 
I am using this platform to sharpen my querying skills, learn new concepts, and prepare for technical interviews in the data analytics and data science space.
Each solution is my own attempt at solving the problem efficiently and readably.

🤔 My Problem-Solving Approach

1.  Deconstruct the Prompt: I carefully read the problem to fully understand the requirements and expected output.
2.  Analyze the Schema: I review the table structures and identify the necessary columns and relationships for joining.
3.  Formulate a Plan: I outline the query logic in plain English or pseudocode before writing any SQL. This usually involves identifying the right clauses (`JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`) and functions.
4.  Write & Iterate: I build the query step-by-step, running it against test cases to validate each part.
5.  Refactor for Clarity: Once I have a working solution, I optimize for readability and performance, often using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex logic.
